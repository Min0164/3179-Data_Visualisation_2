                     The overall trend of the suicide rate for year between 1895 and 1899 was not shown due to the lack of data

                    From the line, it is apparent that average suicide rate per 100,000 population in Europe did not show significant changes, ranging between 13.56 and 19.37.
                    <br><br>
                   With each point representing a different nation, we can see that the majority of the nation has a <span class="point">lower suicide rate that is lower than average</span>

For instance, Lithuania in 2000.
